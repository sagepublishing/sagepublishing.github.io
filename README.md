# sagepublishing.github.io

This repo contains the GitHub Pages website that documents the standards we expect of all internal and external teams
working on development projects at SAGE.

Each push to the main branch triggers a build of the site, made available publicly at
[https://sagepublishing.github.io](https://sagepublishing.github.io).

## Contribution guidelines

### Requesting changes

Anyone at SAGE can create a branch of this repo and submit a pull request. Changes will be reviewed by members
of the SAGE Tech Advisory Board and considered for inclusion in the guide.

Pull requests must receive at least one approval from the following Tech Advisory Board members before they can be
merged:

* [Andy Hails](https://github.com/andyleanlibrary)
* [David Brooks](https://github.com/junglebarry)
* [Matt Moran](https://github.com/foomatty)
* [Michael Sisolak](https://github.com/msisolak)

### Major changes

For whole new journeys, or fundamental changes to existing journeys, consider raising an [issue](/issue) first for
discussion, before raising a pull request.

## Local development

You can build and run the site locally using Docker on *nix systems via the script `./start-dev.sh`. Windows users,
you are most welcome to submit a PR with an equivalent script. ;-)
