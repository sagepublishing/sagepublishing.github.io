### Welcome to the SAGE Development Standards handbook

This website documents the standards we expect of all internal and external teams working on development projects at SAGE.

The standards are tech-agnositc and apply to all projects which are deployed into a production, customer-facing environment. 

Standards are divided into a number of journeys, detailed in the menu on the right hand side. Each journey has a number of steps which should be followed in order. Be sure your project complies with the steps in order, some later steps rely on earlier ones. 

Some of the steps are mandatory, and projects must ensure they comply without delay. These mandatory steps are the minimum quality bar for development projects at SAGE. 

Project teams should consider how to implement optional steps at a suitable future date that works for that project's wider business requirements.
